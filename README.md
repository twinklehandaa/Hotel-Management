The hotel management system is to generalize and
simplify the monthly or daily activities of hotel like room
activities, check in of new customers, check out of
customers, assigning a room according to customer
requirement, show hotel room facilities, book rooms and
finally compute the bill etc. which has to be performed
repeatedly on regular basis. To provide efficient, fast,
reliable, and user-friendly system is the basic motto
behind this project.
